# embalse
This is a project to fetch the status of the reservoir at Manzanares el Real from the web embalses.net
After fetch the data (updated from that web weekly) it write the value on a postgreSQL table
I add all old data since 2020-01-05
This table can be used with metabase (https://metabase.com) to add dashboards and combine the info with weather data.
